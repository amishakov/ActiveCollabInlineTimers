# Active Collab Inline Timers

Active Collab Inline Timers provides instant access to timers on any Active Collab page that lists tasks.

### Overview

Active Collab Inline Timers provides a streamlined interface for tracking, editing, and submitting time to your Active Collab site. You can start, stop, and pause timers from your my work or project pages. You can set defaults for your timers from the extensions popup. These defaults are on a per hostname basis (so if you're part of two different Active Collab sites, you can have individual preferences for each).

### Contributing

### Supported Versions

Active Collab Inline Timers was tested against Active Collab version 5.11.0 through 5.13.133 as well as version 6.0.50.  It theoretically should work in all of versions 5 and 6.

### Theme Support

You can now choose your color scheme in the preferences to match Active Collab coloring or go with a traffic light style pattern.
